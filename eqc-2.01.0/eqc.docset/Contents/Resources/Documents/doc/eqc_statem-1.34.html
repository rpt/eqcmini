<p>Copyright Â© Quviq AB, 2004-2015</p>

<p><b>Version:</b> 1.34.3</p>

<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2>This module provides functions for testing operations with side-effects,
 which are specified via an abstract state machine. The state machine is in turn
 specified by a client module (which implements the behaviour eqc_statem).
 Given such a client, this module can generate and run command sequences, checking that
 all postconditions are satisfied, and shrinking failing sequences by discarding
 commands which do not contribute to the failure. Thus it can be used to find
 minimal command sequences which elicit an unexpected
 behaviour.
 <p>
 It can also generate parallel test cases from the same client
 module, which are used to test for race conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
 Modules which use this one should
 <tt>-include_lib("eqc/include/eqc_statem")</tt> to import the
 functions that <tt>eqc_statem</tt> provides.
 </p>
 <h3>Symbolic Commands</h3>
 Generated test cases are lists of symbolic commands (<a href="#type-command"><code>command()</code></a>), each
 of which binds a symbolic variable to the result of a symbolic function call (except,
 possibly, for a first command which initializes the <i>state</i>, see below).
 For example,
 <pre>{set,{var,1},{call,erlang,whereis,[a]}}</pre>
 is a command to set variable 1 to the result of calling <tt>erlang:whereis(a)</tt>.
 When a test case is run, then symbolic variables (<a href="#type-var"><code>var()</code></a>) are replaced
 by the values they were set to, and symbolic calls (<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>) are
 performed. In addition, the post-condition of each command is checked. Running
 a list of commands generates a result which indicates whether
 any post-condition failed, or any command raised an exception, or whether all
 commands and checks completed successfully.
 <p>
 It is very important to keep in mind the difference between <i>symbolic</i>
 calls and variables, which are used during test case generation, and the
 values they represent, which are computed during test execution. We refer to
 the latter as <i>dynamic</i> values. The reason we use
 symbolic representations (rather than just working with their dynamic values)
 is to enable us to display, save, analyze,
 and above all simplify test cases before they are run.
 </p>
 <h3>States</h3>
 The client module defines an initial state in which test cases begin, and how each
 command changes that state. For example, if test cases spawn a number of processes,
 then the state might be a list of the pids that have been spawned. The state is
 used both during test case <i>generation</i> and during test <i>execution</i>.
 Obviously, at generation time the actual values returned by commands are not
 known--they must be represented symbolically. Thus during test
 generation a <i>symbolic state</i> is constructed---in this case it might be
 <pre>[{var,1},{var,2},{var,3}]</pre>
 if the first three commands all spawned processes. During test execution the
 corresponding <i>dynamic state</i> is computed--in this case a list of three
 pids returned by the first three commands in the test case. Dynamic states always
 have the same structure as the corresponding symbolic states--the difference is
 just that symbolic variables and calls are replaced by their values.
 <p>
 Symbolic states are
 used to generate symbolic commands, or to decide whether a given symbolic command
 can be included in a test case. Dynamic states are used to check postconditions.
 </p>
 <p>It is not usually necessary to track <i>all</i> relevant state information in
 the test case state--there is no need to include more information in the state
 than is necessary to generate and execute the command sequences we are interested in.</p>
 <h3>Callback Functions</h3>
 The client module specifies an abstract state machine by defining the following
 functions:
 <ul>
 <li> <h3>initial_state/0</h3>
 <tt>initial_state() :: <a href="#type-symbolic_state"><code>symbolic_state()</code></a></tt>.
 <p>Returns the state in which each test case starts (unless a different initial
 state is supplied explicitly). This symbolic state is evaluated to
 construct the initial dynamic state before each test case is executed.</p>
 </li>
 <li> <h3>precondition/2</h3>
 <tt>precondition(S::<a href="#type-symbolic_state"><code>symbolic_state()</code></a>,C::<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>) :: bool()</tt>
 <p>Returns <tt>true</tt> if the symbolic call <tt>C</tt> can be performed in the
 state <tt>S</tt>. Preconditions are used to decide whether or not to include
 candidate commands in test cases, which is why only the <i>symbolic</i> state
 information is available when preconditions are checked.</p>
 </li>
 <li><h3>adapt/2</h3>
 <tt>adapt(S::<a href="#type-symbolic_state"><code>symbolic_state()</code></a>, C::<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>) :: gen(<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>)</tt>
 <p> This is an <i>optional</i> call-back used during
 shrinking; when a precondition does not hold, adapt is called to try to repair/patch a
 call before it is discarded. Typically metadata in the call tuple can be adjusted.
 This function may be <i>partial</i>, i.e. if it crashes it
 is interpreted as no adaptation is possible. After adapt is finished, the precondition
 is checked again to see whether the changes were sufficient.</p>
 </li>
 <li> <h3>command/1</h3>
 <tt>command :: (S::<a href="#type-symbolic_state"><code>symbolic_state()</code></a>) :: gen(<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a></tt>
 <p>Generates an appropriate symbolic function call to appear next
 in a test case, if the symbolic state is <tt>S</tt>. Test sequences are generated
 by using <tt>command(S)</tt> repeatedly. However, generated calls are only included in test sequences if
 their precondition is also <tt>true</tt>.</p></li>
 <li><h3>postcondition/3</h3>
 <tt>postcondition(S::<a href="#type-dynamic_state"><code>dynamic_state()</code></a>,C::<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>,R::term()) :: bool()</tt>
 <p>Checks the postcondition of symbolic call <tt>C</tt>, executed in <i>dynamic</i>
 state <tt>S</tt>, with result <tt>R</tt>. The arguments of the symbolic call  are the
 actual values passed, not any symbolic expressions from which they were computed.
 Thus when a postcondition is checked, we know the function called, the values it
 was passed, the value it returned, and the state in which it was called.</p>
 <p>Of course, postconditions are checked during test execution, not test
 generation.</p></li>
 <li><h3>call_features/3</h3>
 <tt>call_features(S::<a href="#type-dynamic_state"><code>dynamic_state()</code></a>,C::<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>,R::term()) :: list(any())</tt>
 <p>Collects the <i>features</i> of a symbolic call <tt>C</tt>, executed in <i>dynamic</i>
 state <tt>S</tt>, with result <tt>R</tt>. The arguments of the symbolic call  are the
 actual values passed, not any symbolic expressions from which they were computed.
 The result is a list of features, which can later be retrieved from
 the test execution history by using <a href="#call_features-1"><code>call_features/1</code></a>.</p>
 <p>Features are collected during test execution, not test
 generation.</p></li>
 <li><h3>next_state/3</h3>
 <tt>next_state(S::<a href="#type-symbolic_state"><code>symbolic_state()</code></a>,R::<a href="#type-var"><code>var()</code></a>,C::<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>) :: <a href="#type-symbolic_state"><code>symbolic_state()</code></a></tt>
 <p>This is the state transition function of the abstract state machine,
 and it is used during <i>both</i> test generation and test
 execution. The type above refers to calls during test generation.</p>
 <p>In this case, it computes the symbolic state after symbolic
 call <tt>C</tt>, performed in
 symbolic state <tt>S</tt>, with result <tt>R</tt>. Because it is applied
 to symbolic states and symbolic calls, the result of the call must also be symbolic--
 in fact, <tt>R</tt> is the symbolic variable which will be set to the result
 of the call. <tt>R</tt> can then be included in the next state if necessary.
 For example, if the state were a list
 of pids, and <tt>C</tt> spawned a new process, then the variable <tt>R</tt>
 could be added to the state to refer to the pid of the process just spawned.
 Symbolic function calls can also be included in the next state, to construct parts
 whose values will only be known during test execution.</p>
 <p>The same function is used to compute the next <i>dynamic</i> state during
 test execution. In this case <tt>S</tt> is the previous dynamic state,
 <tt>C</tt> is a symbolic call in which the arguments are the actual values
 passed (not symbolic argument expressions), and <tt>R</tt> is the actual
 value returned--in other words, all the symbolic inputs are replaced by
 their values. A correctly written next_state function does not inspect
 symbolic inputs--it just includes them as symbolic parts of the result.
 Thus the same code can construct a dynamic state of the same shape,
 given actual values instead of symbolic ones. The only difficulty is that
 next_state may itself introduce symbolic function calls into its result,
 which would then be a kind of mixture of a symbolic and dynamic state.
 To ensure that the state remains dynamic during test execution, any
 such symbolic calls are performed, and replaced by their values,
 before test execution continues.</p></li>
 <li><h3>invariant/1</h3>
 <tt>invariant(S::<a href="#type-dynamic_state"><code>dynamic_state()</code></a>) :: bool()</tt>
 <p>
 This is an <i>optional</i> call-back which can be used to check an
 invariant during test execution. It is called at the beginning of
 each command sequence with the initial state as argument, and then
 after each command is executed with the resulting state as
 argument. Its argument is always a <i>dynamic</i> state; it is not
 used during test case generation.  If <tt>invariant</tt> returns
 anything other than <tt>true</tt>, the test fails. Its intended use
 is to compare the model state <tt>S</tt> with the actual state of
 the system under test.
 </p><p>
 If <tt>invariant</tt> is not defined by the user, then it is assumed
 to be <tt>true</tt>.
 </p>
 </li>
 <li><h3>dynamic_precondition/2</h3>
 <tt>dynamic_precondition(S::<a href="#type-dynamic_state"><code>dynamic_state()</code></a>,C::<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>) :: bool()</tt>
 <p>
 This is an <i>optional</i> call-back which can be used to check a
 precondition during test <i>execution</i>. Its argument is a
 dynamic state, and a call with the <i>actual</i> argument values
 (even for calls which are generated with symbolic arguments). If it
 returns <tt>false</tt>, then the command is not executed during the test.

 Dynamic preconditions may be easier to write than the normal
 preconditions, because they need not work with symbolic
 values. However, they have significant disadvantages:
 <ul>
 <li>Because they cannot be tested during test case
 <i>generation</i>, then they lead to invalid test cases being
 generated which must be "patched up" during execution. This can
 affect both testing efficiency and test case distribution negatively.
 </li>
 <li>They cannot be used in parallel testing, so if a
 dynamic_precondition call-back is used, then race condition testing
 with <a href="#parallel_commands-1"><code>parallel_commands/1</code></a> is not possible.
 </li>
 </ul>
 For these reasons, it is almost always better to enrich the model
 state so that a static precondition can be defined, than to use a
 dynamic one. In rare cases, and especially when the dynamic
 precondition will usually be <tt>true</tt>, then using this
 call-back can be the best approach.
 </p>
 </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Grouping Callbacks</h3><p>
 Typically each function appearing in generated tests is specified by
 a generator in the <tt>command/1</tt> callback, a clause in the
 <tt>precondition/2</tt> callback, a clause in the
 <tt>next_state</tt> callback, and so on. Thus the specification of
 one function is divided into fragments that appear in different
 places in the model. This can become unwieldy for complex state
 machines, and so <tt>eqc_statem</tt> also supports "grouped"
 specifications, in which all the aspects of a function are specified
 together. The grouped syntax is documented under <a href="eqc_group_commands.html"><code>eqc_group_commands</code></a>.</p>

 <h3>What Property Should We Test?</h3>
 This module does <i>not</i> define any properties to test, it only provides
 functions to make defining such properties easy. A client module will
 normally contain a property resembling this one, which generates a
 command sequence using the client state machine, and then tests it:
 <pre>prop_statem_correct() -&gt;
   ?FORALL(Cmds,commands(client),
     begin {H,S,Res} = run_commands(client,Cmds),
           check_commands(client,Cmds,{H,S,Res}).
     end).</pre><p> 
However, in any particular case we may wish to add a little to this 
basic form, for example to collect statistics, to clean up after 
test execution, or to print more information in the event of failure. 
It is to allow this flexibility that the properties to test are 
placed in the client module, rather than in this one.</p>

 <h3>Parallel Testing</h3>
 Parallel test cases are generated using <a href="#parallel_commands-1"><code>parallel_commands/1</code></a>
 instead of <a href="#commands-1"><code>commands/1</code></a>. Instead of just one list of commands,
 a parallel test case consists of a sequential prefix, followed by a
 list of concurrent tasks. The prefix and each task are lists
 of commands, just like a sequential test case. A parallel test case
 is run using <a href="#run_parallel_commands-2"><code>run_parallel_commands/2</code></a>, by first executing the
 prefix in the normal way, then executing the concurrent tasks in
 newly spawned processes. The test passes if every command behaves
 <i>atomically</i>--that is, if the results we actually see could
 have been produced by some serialization of the concurrent
 tasks.
 <p>
 <i>Blocking</i> operations can be specified using the optional
 <tt>blocking/2</tt> callback:
 <pre>
 blocking(S::<a href="#type-dynamic_state"><code>dynamic_state()</code></a>,C::<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>) :: bool()</pre>
 If <tt>blocking/2</tt> is not defined in the state machine
 specification, then it is assumed always to return <tt>false</tt>.
 If <tt>blocking</tt> returns <tt>true</tt>, then QuickCheck assumes
 that the given call blocks in that state, allowing concurrent non-blocking
 calls to proceed first. Hopefully one of these will change the state
 so as to allow the blocking call to proceed. If not, QuickCheck
 expects the blocking call to <i>time out</i> eventually, allowing
 the test case to finish. Blocking operations can be included in test
 cases even if the <tt>blocking/2</tt> call-back is not defined, but
 QuickCheck can find more bugs given the additional information that
 <tt>blocking/2</tt> represents. </p>
 <p>
 The properties for parallel testing are very similar to those for
 sequential testing: we just replace the <a href="#commands-1"><code>commands/1</code></a> and
 <a href="#run_commands-2"><code>run_commands/2</code></a> functions by their parallel versions. Often,
 though, the race conditions we are testing for only occur sometimes,
 and so we need to repeat each test several times using
 <b>?ALWAYS</b> to be reasonably sure of provoking it. It is only
 really necessary to do this during shrinking (since otherwise
 shrinking is likely to stop before the test case is properly
 simplified). Using this idea, a property that tests each case once
 while initially searching for a failure, then ten times at each
 shrinking step, could be written as
 <pre>prop_atomic() -&gt;
   ?FORALL(Repetitions,?SHRINK(1,[10]),
     ?FORALL(ParCmds,parallel_commands(client),
       ?ALWAYS(Repetitions,
         begin {H,S,Result} = run_parallel_commands(client,ParCmds),
               check_commands(client,ParCmds,{H,S,Result})
         end))).</pre>
 Note also that the results from <a href="#run_parallel_commands-2"><code>run_parallel_commands/2</code></a> are
 a little different from those of <a href="run_commands.html"><code>run_commands</code></a>.
 </p>

 <p>One difference to be aware of is that postconditions and
 invariants are not checked <i>during</i> a parallel test, they are
 checked <i>afterwards</i> using the results collected from the
 concurrent tasks. This means that the postcondition and invariant
 callbacks cannot inspect the <i>current state</i> of the software 
under test, when they are used in parallel testing.</p>

 <tt>linearizable(ParCmds)</tt> can be used to insert calls to
 <tt>now()</tt> into the generated test case, giving more information
 to be used when deciding whether tests passed or failed.

<p> A symbolic function call:
 {call,M,F,Args} represents a call of function F in module M, with arguments Args.
 {call,M,F,Args,Meta} represents a call with metadata (which may be symbolic).
 Metadata does not affect the way the call is executed, but is passed

<p><tt>command() = {set, <a href="#type-var">var()</a>, <a href="#type-call">call()</a>} | {init, <a href="#type-symbolic_state">symbolic_state()</a>}</tt></p>
<p> A symbolic command, which when run either
 performs a call and binds the result to a variable, or initialises
 the state of the test case. (The latter appears only when <a href="#commands-2"><code>commands/2</code></a>
 in used to generate a command sequence starting in a state other than
 initial_state()).</p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-command_history">command_history()</a></h3>
<p><tt>command_history() = [{<a href="#type-command">command()</a>, term()}]</tt></p>
<p> A list of commands and their results. The arguments in each call are the
 <i>evaluated</i> arguments, not the symbolic ones.</p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-dynamic_state">dynamic_state()</a></h3>
<p><tt>dynamic_state() = any()</tt></p>
<p> The type used by the client module to represent
 the state of a test case during test execution. It is the same as
 <a href="#type-symbolic_state"><code>symbolic_state()</code></a>, except that symbolic variables and calls
 are replaced by their values.</p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-exit">exit()</a></h3>
<p><tt>exit() = {'EXIT', term()}</tt></p>
<p> The type of a caught exception.</p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-expr">expr()</a></h3>
<p><tt>expr() = term()</tt></p>
<p> A symbolic expression, which is evaluated by
 replacing any symbolic variables (<a href="#type-var"><code>var()</code></a>) or function calls
 (<a href="#type-call"><code>call()</code></a>) in the term by their values.</p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-history">history()</a></h3>
<p><tt>history() = [{<a href="#type-dynamic_state">dynamic_state()</a>, term()}]</tt></p>
<p> The history of a

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-parallel_test_case">parallel_test_case()</a></h3>
<p><tt>parallel_test_case() = {[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>], [[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>]]}</tt></p>
<p> A sequential prefix, and a list of concurrent child tasks.</p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-proplist">proplist()</a></h3>
<p><tt>proplist() = [{atom(), <a href="#type-expr">expr()</a>}]</tt></p>

<p><tt>reason() = ok | initialization | {precondition, boolean()} | {postcondition, any()} | {invariant, any()} | {exception, <a href="#type-exit">exit()</a>}</tt></p>
<p> The reason execution of a command sequence terminated.
 <ul>
 <li><h3>ok</h3>
 <p>All commands completed normally, and all postconditions were true.</p>
 </li>
 <li><h3>initialization</h3>
 <p>There was an exception when computing the initial state--that is, converting the
 result of initial_state() to a <a href="#type-dynamic_state"><code>dynamic_state()</code></a>.</p></li>
 <li><h3>precondition</h3>
 <p>A precondition failed to return <tt>true</tt> <i>during test execution</i>.
 Since preconditions are checked when tests are generated, this should not normally
 happen. It is possible
 when using <a href="eqc.html#check-2"><code>eqc:check/2</code></a> to rerun a saved test, after modifying the code,
 or if one of the functions <tt>initial_state/0</tt>, <tt>next_state/3</tt>, or
 <tt>precondition/2</tt> behaves differently at generation time and test execution
 time. For example, a pattern match on a symbolic variable (<tt>{var,N}</tt>) will
 behave differently during test case generation and execution--so any such pattern
 matching is a warning sign.
 </p>
 </li>
 <li><h3>postcondition</h3>
 <p>A postcondition failed to return <tt>true</tt>.</p></li>
 <li><h3>invariant</h3>
 <p>An invariant failed to return <tt>true</tt>.</p></li>
 <li><h3>exception</h3>
 <p>One of the commands in the sequence raised an exception. In this case the
 <a href="#type-history"><code>history()</code></a> contains all previous commands, and the final state is
 the state just before the faulty command was executed.</p></li>
 </ul></p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-symbolic_state">symbolic_state()</a></h3>
<p><tt>symbolic_state() = any()</tt></p>

 the state of a test case during test case generation.</p>

<h3 class="typedecl"><a name="type-var">var()</a></h3>
<p><tt>var() = {var, integer()}</tt></p>
<p> A symbolic variable, which is replace during test execution by the value bound
 by the corresponding <a href="#type-command"><code>command()</code></a>.</p>

<div class="spec">
<p><tt>apply(M, F, As) -&gt; any()</tt></p>
</div><p>Equivalent to <a href="erlang.html#apply-3"><tt>erlang:apply(M, F, As)</tt></a>.</p>


<h3 class="function"><a name="call_features-1">call_features/1</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>call_features(H::<a href="#type-history">history()</a>) -&gt; [any()]</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Returns a list of command features exercised in this test.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="call_features-2">call_features/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>call_features(F::atom() | {atom(), <a href="#type-int">int()</a>}, H::<a href="#type-history">history()</a>) -&gt; [any()]</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Returns a list of features exercised by calls to <tt>F</tt> (or
 <tt>F/A</tt>, if the arity is also specified).</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="check_commands-3">check_commands/3</a></h3>
<div class="spec">

</div><p>Check the result of run_commands. The recommended way to write
  an eqc_statem property is in the form
  <pre>
  X = run_commands(Mod,Cmds),
  ...any clean-up code...
  check_commands(Mod,Cmds,X)
  </pre>
  This:
  <ul><li>Checks that the commands ran successfully (and all
  postconditions were true),</li>
  <li>Gathers statistics on the commands appearing in generated
  tests, using <tt>aggregate(command_names(Cmds),...)</tt></li>
  <li>Discards test cases in which a precondition failed.</li>
  </ul>
  Additional checks can be combined with <tt>check_commands</tt>
  using <a href="eqc.html#conjunction-1"><code>eqc:conjunction/1</code></a>.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="check_commands-4">check_commands/4</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>check_commands(Mod::atom(), Cmds::[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>], HSRes::{<a href="#type-history">history()</a>, <a href="#type-dynamic_state">dynamic_state()</a>, <a href="#type-reason">reason()</a>}, Env::[{atom(), term()}]) -&gt; <a href="#type-property">property()</a></tt><br></p>
</div><p>Like <a href="#check_commands-3"><code>check_commands/3</code></a>, but also takes the environment
  passed to <a href="#run_commands-3"><code>run_commands/3</code></a> as an additional parameter.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="command_names-1">command_names/1</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>command_names(Cmds::[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>]) -&gt; [{atom(), atom(), integer()}]</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Returns a list of the command names used in <tt>Cmds</tt>. This
 function can be used in properties to measure the frequency with
 which each command actually occurs in the generated test cases, as follows:
 <pre>
 ?FORALL(Cmds,commands(...),
   begin
     {H,S,Res} = run_commands(...,Cmds),
     aggregate(command_names(Cmds),
               Res==ok)
   end)
 </pre></p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="commands-1">commands/1</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>commands(Mod::atom()) -&gt; <a href="#type-gen">gen</a>([<a href="#type-command">command()</a>])</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Generates a list of commands, using the abstract state machine defined
 in module <tt>Mod</tt>. The commands in the sequence are generated by
 Mod:command/1, starting in the state Mod:initial_state(), and tracking
 state changes using Mod:next_state/3. Commands are only included in the
 sequence if their precondition (given by Mod:precondition/2) is satisfied.
 Sequences are shrunk by discarding commands in such a way that
 preconditions always hold, and all variables are set before they are used.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="commands-2">commands/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>commands(Mod::atom(), S::<a href="#type-symbolic_state">symbolic_state()</a>) -&gt; <a href="#type-gen">gen</a>([<a href="#type-command">command()</a>])</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Behaves like <a href="#commands-1"><code>commands/1</code></a>, but generates a list of
 commands starting in state S. To ensure the correct state when the
 commands are run, the first command is <tt>{init,S}</tt>.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="eq-2">eq/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>eq(X, Y) -&gt; true | {X, '/=', Y}</tt>
<ul class="definitions"><li><tt>X = term()</tt></li><li><tt>Y = term()</tt></li></ul></p>
</div><p>Compare X and Y for equality, returns true if equal, and {X, '/=', Y}
  otherwise. Typically used in postcondition; since it will result in a more informative
  counterexample.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="get_metadata-2">get_metadata/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>get_metadata(Key::term(), Cmd::<a href="#type-call">call()</a>) -&gt; false | {ok, term()}</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Retreive a field from the MetaData component. This function pre-suppose that the
  meta data is organized in the form of a proplist with {Key, Value}-pairs.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="linearizable-1">linearizable/1</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>linearizable(TestCase::<a href="#type-parallel_test_case">parallel_test_case()</a>) -&gt; <a href="#type-parallel_test_case">parallel_test_case()</a></tt><br></p>
</div><p>Adds calls of eqc_statem:now() before and after each command
  in the parallel part of the test case, which enables us to
  <i>observe</i> the order in which calls are made. This gives us
  more information with which to determine whether a test passed or
  failed, which may improve the detection of races. On the other
  hand, calling now() involves a global synchronization, and so may
  make race conditions <i>less</i> likely to appear.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="more_commands-2">more_commands/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>more_commands(N::<a href="#type-int">int()</a>, Gen::<a href="#type-gen">gen</a>(A)) -&gt; <a href="#type-gen">gen</a>(A)</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Increases the expected length of command sequences generated within Gen by
 a factor N.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="now-0">now/0</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>now() -&gt; any()</tt></p>
</div><p>Equivalent to <a href="erlang.html#now-0"><tt>erlang:now()</tt></a>.</p>


<h3 class="function"><a name="parallel_commands-1">parallel_commands/1</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>parallel_commands(Mod::atom()) -&gt; <a href="#type-gen">gen</a>(<a href="#type-parallel_test_case">parallel_test_case()</a>)</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Generate a parallel test case from the callbacks in the client
  module <tt>Mod</tt>. These test cases are used to test for race
  conditions that make the commands in the tests behave non-atomically.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="parallel_commands-2">parallel_commands/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>parallel_commands(Mod::atom(), S::<a href="#type-symbolic_state">symbolic_state()</a>) -&gt; <a href="#type-gen">gen</a>(<a href="#type-parallel_test_case">parallel_test_case()</a>)</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Behaves like <a href="#parallel_commands-1"><code>parallel_commands/1</code></a>, but generates a test
  case starting in the state <tt>S</tt>.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="postconditions-3">postconditions/3</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>postconditions(Mod::atom(), Cmds::[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>], Vals::[term()]) -&gt; bool()</tt><br></p>
</div><p>Given the values returned by a list of
 commands, checks that all pre- and postconditions are satisfied. Mod
 is a module defining a state machine, Cmds a list of commands
 generated from it, and Vals the list of values returned by running
 those commands. This function is useful when the list of commands
 cannot be run just by calling <a href="#run_commands-2"><code>run_commands/2</code></a>, for example
 because the commands represent calls to functions in a different
 programming language.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="pretty_commands-4">pretty_commands/4</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>pretty_commands(Mod::atom(), Cmds::[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>], HSRes::{<a href="#type-history">history()</a>, <a href="#type-dynamic_state">dynamic_state()</a>, <a href="#type-reason">reason()</a>}, P::<a href="#type-property">property()</a>) -&gt; <a href="#type-property">property()</a></tt><br></p>
</div><p>Pretty-prints the execution history of a failing test, showing
  the calls made, the actual arguments and results, and (optionally)
  the model states. Like <tt>?WHENFAIL</tt>, <a href="pretty_commands.html"><code>pretty_commands</code></a>
  takes the rest of the property as its last argument, and constructs
  a new property that also pretty-prints. The argument <tt>Cmds</tt>
  should be the list of commands passed to <a href="#run_commands-2"><code>run_commands/2</code></a>,
  and <tt>HSRes</tt> should be its result. Alternatively
  (notwithstanding the type signature above) a parallel test case
  generated by <a href="#parallel_commands-1"><code>parallel_commands/1</code></a>, and the result of
  <a href="#run_parallel_commands-2"><code>run_parallel_commands/2</code></a>, can be passed instead.
  <p>
  The pretty-printing can be customized using
  <a href="eqc_gen.html#with_parameter-3"><code>eqc_gen:with_parameter/3</code></a> to specify
  <ul>
  <li><tt>show_states</tt> (<tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>), to
  determine whether model states should be included in the output,</li>
  <li><tt>pretty_width</tt> (an integer), to specify the width
  available for pretty-printing.</li>
  </ul>
  Note that these parameters are parameters to the entire property,
  and can be specified when <a href="eqc.html#quickcheck-1"><code>eqc:quickcheck/1</code></a> is called from the Erlang shell.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, the simplest way to show the states when a property fails is to call
  <pre>
  eqc:quickcheck(eqc_statem:show_states(...property...)).
  </pre>
  from the shell.</p></p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="pretty_commands-5">pretty_commands/5</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>pretty_commands(Mod::atom(), Cmds::[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>], HSRes::{<a href="#type-history">history()</a>, <a href="#type-dynamic_state">dynamic_state()</a>, <a href="#type-reason">reason()</a>}, Env::[{atom(), term()}], P::<a href="#type-property">property()</a>) -&gt; <a href="#type-property">property()</a></tt><br></p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="run_commands-2">run_commands/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">

</div><p>Runs a list of commands specified by the abstract state machine
 in client module <tt>Mod</tt>. Before each command is run, its precondition is
 checked by Mod:precondition/2, and after each command is executed, its
 postcondition is checked by Mod:postcondition/3. The result contains the
 <a href="#type-history"><code>history()</code></a> of execution, the state after the last command that was
 executed successfully, and the <a href="#type-reason"><code>reason()</code></a> execution stopped.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="run_commands-3">run_commands/3</a></h3>
<div class="spec">

</div><p>Behaves like <a href="#run_commands-2"><code>run_commands/2</code></a>, but also takes an environment
 containing values for additional variables that may be referred
 to in test cases. For example, if <tt>Env</tt> is <tt>[{x,32}]</tt>,
 then <tt>{var,x}</tt> may appear in the commands, and will evaluate
 to 32. The variables names must be atoms (unlike generated variable
 names, which are numbers).</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="run_parallel_commands-2">run_parallel_commands/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">

</div><p>Like <a href="#run_commands-2"><code>run_commands/2</code></a>, but also takes an

<h3 class="function"><a name="show_states-1">show_states/1</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>show_states(Prop::<a href="#type-property">property()</a>) -&gt; <a href="#type-property">property()</a></tt><br></p>
</div><p>Causes a call of <a href="#pretty_commands-4"><code>pretty_commands/4</code></a> or <a href="#pretty_commands-5"><code>pretty_commands/5</code></a> in the property to display the test case states
  as well as arguments and results.</p>

<h3 class="function"><a name="state_after-2">state_after/2</a></h3>
<div class="spec">
<p><tt>state_after(Mod::atom(), Cmds::[<a href="#type-command">command()</a>]) -&gt; <a href="#type-symbolic_state">symbolic_state()</a></tt><br></p>

</div><p>Zips two lists together,
 but accepts lists of different lengths, stopping when the shorter
 list stops. This is useful to zip together a list of commands with
 the history returned by <a href="#run_commands-2"><code>run_commands/2</code></a>, to display each
 command together with its result in the output from QuickCheck.</p>
